I decided to start this blog so I can keep track of my progress with some of my projects. The first on is my cat collecting puzzle game. I wanted to make a full game but I needed something that I could realistically complete before summer. This is difficult because of the coursework provided at Rose-Hulman and my procrastination skills. So what is this game about?

## Cat Collecting: The Game

### Inspiration

My girlfriend loves cats and I want to make a game that she would enjoy. She is always wishing she could save any and all cats from the street. It's very sweet but slightly impractical which is where the idea of a game where you have to save all the stray cats in a town came from.

### Scale

In an attempt to balance my time, I wanted to make something with simple interaction. So, the plan is mouse as the only input because I feel like it will hit my target casual game player better.

### Engine

I am using Godot for this project because it's where I ended up after the whole "Unity wants more money" thing. I was relatively proficient at Unity after many years of making random games with my friends but I was starting to get annoyed with it after slow compile times and the removal of the super amazing and iconic launcher/options window.

### Art

I am really (subjectively) bad at art. If you think that cat looks good, I traced it and look at this one below. I am drawing these on my iPad which is super convenient and the results are not that bad as long as I trace something and keep to my theme. Pixel art would actually be a lot worse in my opinion because it would take me so long to make something I was happy about. The cats are kinda gonna all be unique styles so hopefully nobody will care about Orange Cat and compare it directly to Foot Cat.

In conclusion, I am making a game for my girlfriend and hopefully some people like it!
